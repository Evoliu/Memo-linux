Today I added a new 4TB diskdrive to my desktop(Ubuntu 12.04)
  I have tried "gparted" and it worked well , but I choosed using the disktool coming from Linux, finally.
  
Here is the steps:
         (1) change dir to "root"
         (2) sudo df ---see all disk 
         (3) partition : 基本パーティション
         (4) format : ext4
         (5) mount /"THE DISK" /DIR
         (6) change dir to "THE DISK" and mkdir a dir 
        ----done
